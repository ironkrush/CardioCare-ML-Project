# Heart Disease Detection ML Model

## Description

Welcome to the Heart Disease Detection ML Model repository! This project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a machine learning model. Built using Python along with NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (imblearn), and Streamlit for deployment, this model provides a convenient and accessible way to assess potential risks of heart disease.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilize scikit-learn to train a machine learning model for heart disease prediction, leveraging algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or support vector machines.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Address imbalanced class distribution in the dataset using techniques provided by imbalanced-learn to improve the model's predictive performance.
- **Streamlit Deployment:** Deploy the trained model using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input their health metrics and receive predictions on the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Caution:** Please note that this model is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is not intended to replace professional medical advice or diagnosis. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns or advice. The predictions made by this model are based on statistical analysis and should be interpreted with caution.
